= The Internet Web in a Jar
:author: Schalk W. Cronj√©

This is a JRuby packaged version of https://github.com/tourdedave[Dave Haeffner's]
https://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet[The Internet] project. I have packaged it
up for the main purposes of allowing people to learn the use of web UI testing frameworks
on the UI such as Selenium and http://gebish.org[Geb].

If you want to see a running version of the original Ruby app have a look at  http://the-internet.herokuapp.com.

This little project has two aims:

* Ability to run the website within a unittest [*DONE*]
* Ability to run it as a standalone app on any OS that has a JVM installed, without installing any additional
libraries. [*IN PROGRESS*].

== Use in a unittest

NOTE: Currently the artifact is not published online as yet. (will be soon). For now clone this repo and
build it with `./gradlew build install`. It will place the current SNAPSHOT in your local Maven repo.

.Usage in a spock test
```groovy
import org.ysb33r.theinternet.TestableWebServer

class testExampleSpec extends Specification {

    @Shared
    @AutoCleanup("stop")
    TestableWebServer server = new TestableWebServer() // <1>

    void setupSpec() {
        server.start()
    }

}
```
<1> By default this will listen on port `4567`.

== Running standalone

*TBC*
